CHANGELOG

2.7.8

# Bugs Fixed
* Text-shadow colour could not be set to "none" to effectively disable any existing text-shadow values.
* RGB AND RGBA colour values could not be set without Microthemer auto-adjusting them to solid hex values. 
RGB/RGBA values can now be manually added. The color picker will receive some proper attention in the near future to ensure maximum flexibility and ease of use.
* A call to an undefined javascript function caused an error in the browser console. Although the error didn't seem to disrupt normal functioning of the program.

2.7.5 (Sept 1, 2014)

# Bugs Fixed
* The new feature of computing the CSS could slow, and potentially crash the browser. 
This could happen when analysing high numbers of page elements (e.g. 30 links on the page) combined with lots of properties having mixed values (e.g. a font-size of 12px, 18px, 21px). 
As A quick fix, we have set the maximum number of elements on the page that can be scanned to 10 (instead of 50). We will increase this figure (to around 30) when we release version 3 in about one month. 
Version 3 will segment the display of property groups (e.g. just padding or just behaviour) rather than displaying all properties at once and so will be able to analyse more elements on the page without resulting in performance issues.
* Also, related to the above, Microthemer now excludes the WP admin bar from restyling for performance reasons.
* If a selector contained the :link pseudo selector, this wasn't correctly filtered when constructing selector highlighting divs.

2.7.3 (Aug 8, 2014)

# Bugs Fixed
* Computed CSS reporting failed if the CSS selector code contained one of the following pseudo selectors - :hover, :active, :visited

2.7.2 (Aug 6, 2014)

# Enhancement
* Google font subsets e.g. "subset=latin,latin-ext" can now be set on the Microthemer > Preferences page

# Bugs Fixed
* An error occurred when using single or double quotes in selectors e.g. input[type="text"]

2.7.1 (July 8, 2014)

# Enhancement
* Microthemer can now be used as a substitute for firebug as a tool for analysing an element's existing computed CSS values. Microthemer now shows the computed values as overlays on the editing options so you can view CSS value reporting and make an edit in exactly the same place.
* Font weight can be applied as a century number from 100 to 900.

# Bugs Fixed
* The little "i"s for manually applying the !important CSS declaration got lost for a while.
* When exporting to a theme, it was possible to not select anything from the dropdown menu.
* Custom google font still rendered if the field wasn't cleared before switching back to a regular web safe font in the dropdown.
* Auto-save was a bit sketchy with Google Fonts too
* Microthemer auto-saves when property options are deleted or a selector is modified now to more accurately present the state of things.
* Microthemer now includes the background-color in the CSS3 gradient declaration. It will always be trumped by the gradient but not doing this resulting in incorrect reporting of the background-color property (now that Microthemer reports this information)
* The plugin update checker (not shipped with wordpress.org version) needed updating.


2.6.3 (May 12, 2014)

# Enhancement
* Style changes appear much quicker now (almost instantly). As such, auto-save is now the default mode (although it can be disabled). Also, auto-save is trggered when you finish typing into text fields (after a 700ms delay, rather than when focus is removed). 
* Microthemer remembers the last page you viewed when you return to the visual view site preview

2.6.1.1 (May 8, 2014)

# Bugs Fixed
* Found another call to the missing json class the previous version aimed to fix (2.6.1).

2.6.1 (May 8, 2014)

# Bugs Fixed
* When exporting settings to a settings pack, or invoking any function that used the json class, an error message was thrown in WordPress 3.9.

2.6 (Apr 2, 2014)

# Bugs Fixed
* Various PHP notices that could display on servers with strict error reporting have been fixed.

2.5.8 (Mar 17, 2014)

# Bugs Fixed
* E_STRICT PHP error warnings could occur with PHP 5.4 due to code aimed at maintaining compatibility with PHP 4. This code has been removed. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

2.5.7 (Jan 14, 2014)

# Bugs Fixed
* There is now only one important "i" icon next to the last text-shadow input field. This makes much more sense.
* wordpress.org only - a file wasn't checked in which was necessary for the new responsive screen width slider to appear correctly.

2.5.6 (Jan 09, 2014)

# Bugs Fixed
* Media queries could be re-ordered but re-ordering did not have an effect with regards to the order the media queries were written to the active-style.css styleheet.

2.5.5 (Dec 28, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Added a major new responsive design feature to the visual view. Preview the frontend in screen widths that correspond to min and max width values specified in your media queries. Also, you can easily adjust the preview screen size manually user a slider. You still have full editorial control over Microthemers default media queries.
* Some CSS tweaks to further improve the design with WordPress 3.8.

# Bugs Fixed
* Under some conditions discarding a media query tab in the style editing options could result in the editing options for the next tab that comes into focus remaining hidden.

2.5.2 (Dec 14, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Various design improvements to ensure compatibility with WordPress 3.8

2.5.1 (Dec 9, 2013)

# Bugs Fixed
* PHP warning error when importing a settings pack that was made before Microthemer introduced media queries. Only affected Microthemer 2.5.

2.5 (Dec 3, 2013)

# Bugs Fixed
* Major bug with device-specific CSS styles disappearing. Previously saved media query styles were overwritten by new ones if the section or selector was closed. This bug was masked prior to the last release (2.4.7) because sections and selectors remained open unless explicitly closed.
* When importing a theme pack that uses device specific css, the tabs could get messed up it focus wasn't left on 'All-devices'.
* Increased the CSS-specificity of Microthemer's own CSS styles on hidden Elements to ensure normal Javascript functioning too.


2.4.7 (Nov 17, 2013)

# Bugs Fixed
* Under some conditions saving settings could result in an error. Servers that have a value in php.ini for max_input_vars (usually 1000) would sometimes truncate the data Microthemer sends to the server, resulting in a save error. Microthemer now warns you in advance if you are approaching your data-sending limits and suggest an easy fix - just hit the SpeedUp button in the right-hand menu.
* By default, Microthemer no longer remembers open sections/selectors when you return to the UI page. Doing so increased the likelihood of the data-limit error described above. However, you can adjust this behaviour via a new option on the preferences page.

2.4.5 (Nov 13, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Four additional Raw CSS Code textareas added for specifically targeting versions of Internet Explorer. Microthemer only includes these additional stylesheets if you make use of the new textareas so no unnecessary stylesheets are ever included.

2.4.4 (Oct 3, 2013)

# Enhancement/Bug Fix
* Option added to preferences page to set the viewport zoom level for any device to "1". This is on by default as it is necessary for the media queries to affect mobile and tablet devices correctly.

2.4.3 (Oct 2, 2013)

# Bugs Fixed
* When importing with "Merge", section name conflicts were not handled if an existing section didn't have any Selectors.
* MAJOR BUG FIXED - Style values of zero (0) were ignored (not written to the CSS stylesheet) in the last version of Microthemer (2.4.1). 

2.4.3 (Oct 2, 2013)

# Bugs Fixed
* When importing with "Merge", section name conflicts were not handled if an existing section didn't have any Selectors.
* MAJOR BUG FIXED - Style values of zero (0) were ignored (not written to the CSS stylesheet) in the last version of Microthemer (2.4.1). 

2.4.1 (Aug 28, 2013)

# Bugs Fixed
* Importing a settings pack with media queries didn't work properly
* The last edited media query tab wasn't always remembered as "in focus"
* Warnings about illegal string offsets when using PHP 5.4 - e.g. when adding a selector (previous MySQL bug fix wasn't effective against illegal string offset error)

2.3.8 (Aug 27, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Microthemer now supports media queries for designing/customizing responsive wordpress themes
* WordPress admin bar shows on frontend by default (but can be turned off on preferences page)

# Bugs Fixed
* Adding a Selector could result in a PHP error on strict servers that don't allow MySQL fields of type "text/longtext" to have a default value. See more info on the issue here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3466872/why-cant-a-text-column-have-a-default-value-in-mysql 

2.3.5 (Aug 7, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Email validation method now more reliable.

# Bugs Fixed
* When extracted, the directory for the plugin was 'crothemer' (with version 2.3.2). Upon upgrading WordPress deactivated the plugin. This will happen again if you are upgrading from 2.3.2 (because the directory name has changed - this time back to normal though).
* Google Font variations can now be correctly used (click the variation before clicking the "Use this Font" link)
* Google Font url uses https if necessary to prevent mixed content warnings on SSL sites.

2.3.2 (July 26, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Transparency on mouseout in visual view is now configurable via Preferences page
* Microthemer now compatible with MP6 (the new WordPress interface design that will be released in future version of wordPress). Some additional design tweaks will be introduced once the new MP6 design becomes the norm.

# Bugs Fixed
* Transparency with editing options intermittently caused z-index problem when scroller was used in Firefox. This is now a configurable option as not sure whether the transparency feature is just a distraction

2.2.9 (July 16, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Support for Google Web Fonts added
* Trial Mode now permits editing/creating 3 Sections and 9 Selectors (3 per section)
* Added in-program video tutorial for adding Google Web Fonts

# Bugs Fixed
* Microthemer permitted section names to be in camelCase. This caused downstream problems when trying to rename a section.
* Links to W3 Schools website in the CSS Reference were broken
* Ctrl+S shortcut failed if focus remained on iframe (after interacting with a menu in the iframe for instance)

2.2.3 (July 9, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Custom CSS style properties can now be added to Selectors in the CSS Selector textarea. Microthemer will look for the use of curly braces and include any CSS properties it finds in between the curly braces.

2.2.2 (July 5, 2013)

# Change
* Removed option to use alternative jQuery and jQuery UI version that used to ship with the plugin, as per WordPress best practice guidelines. If you are running an old version of WordPress and experience problems with this update, you must update WordPress to the latest version to fix the problem.

2.2.1 (July 3, 2013)

# Note
This is the last version of Microthemer to support WordPress versions prior to 3.2.1 (WP 2.8 - 3.2)

# Enhancement
* Added min width/height and max width/height properties to dimensions style group
* Added opacity property to behaviour style group (cross-browser compatible - including IE)
* Added "External Resources" section to in-program docs.
* Preference to always add !important is enabled by default on the Preferences page now (on new installs)

# Bugs Fixed
* Fixed issue with multi-site introduced in version 2.1.5
* Fixed !important assignment on CSS3 properties. There is now only 1 "i" per line as the options come together to form 1 CSS rule.

2.1.5 (June 30, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Added additional Save button at bottom of Preferences page in case users overlook fixed button on the right.
* Added Free Trial Mode. Microthemer can now be downloaded as a free trial from WordPress.org

# Bugs Fixed
* Fixed various CSS layout issues that occurred with older versions of WordPress.
* Fixed undefined function errors with older versions of WordPress.


2.1.2 (June 27, 2013)

# Enhancement
* In visual view, sidebar menu is collapsed by default. A tip for saving settings with the Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut is always displayed.
* Option in Preferences to load visual view by default
* REMOVED Option to activate/deactivate settings packs from Manage Themes page as this option is hazardous. The same can be achieved by importing via the Microthemer UI.
* REMOVED "Edit Theme Styles" link from the Manage Themes page to minimise clutter (you can still easily go to the UI page using the fixed menu on the right) 
* REMOVED "Create New Theme" button from Manage Themes page as it isn't particularly useful (and can be done from Microthemer UI page via Export to and the "New")
the UI page using the fixed menu on the right) 
* REMOVED "Currently Active Theme" dropdown menu as changing this on Preferences page could have unexpected results for users.
* Added In-program Video Guides for version 2

# Bugs Fixed
* z-index erroneously applied px unit
* Microthemer artificial highlighting classes were being suggested by Selector Wizard on parent elements with a class.
* Selector Wizard didn't display after double-click if section selectors needed loading first, or if the section was empty.
* Microthemer's main stylesheet didn't always load on new Installs of Microthemer, or following Theme Deactivation (if no other Micro Theme  was subsequently activated or the Microthemer UI settings were reset)
* Manually adding a selector failed if section selectors hadn't been loaded or section was empty.


2.0 beta (May 8, 2013)

# Enhancement
* Complete redesign of the Visual View. Now, absolutely everything can be done from the visual view
* Killer feature added. Microthemer can now be used with ANY WORDPRESS THEME. Just double click on something (e.g. an image) in the visual view and Microthemer will display a "Selector Wizard" to help you target exactly what you want (e.g. all images, just images in the sidebar etc etc). 
* "SpeedUp" button added to side menu. This can speed up the interface if it slows down after extensive editing. Hover your mouse over the SpeedUp button for more on this.
* Auto-save when style options change (easily configurable on/ff)
* Easy manual save by clicking Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut
* In-program docs improved. Can now search/post in forum right from the app. Also, CSS Reference is more accessible.

# Bugs Fixed
* Resetting the Microthemer UI and clearing styles didn't automatically update the active-styles.css stylesheet to reflect the new state of affairs (an additional save was required to do this). 


1.4.1 (Dec 6, 2012)

# Bugs Fixed
* The angle of CSS3 linear gradients was not consistent across browsers.


1.4 (Sept 6, 2012)

# Enhancement
* Revision History - Settings can now be restored form the previous 20 user actions that changed the Microthemer UI settings (e.g. saving, importing, resetting, activating a micro theme). Useful for undoing any mistakes or recovering from a glitch in the UI.

# Bugs Fixed
* Resetting the Microthemer UI and clearing styles didn't automatically update the active-styles.css stylesheet to reflect the new state of affairs (an additional save was required to do this). 


1.3.8 (Aug 5, 2012)

# Enhancement
* Microthemer now has a better method of ensuring that it's stylesheet loads after other stylesheets (so that it can override styles without resorting to !important). 
* If Microthemer encounters a problem when trying to save your settings, it will prompt you to email an error report to Themeover. We can use these reports to diagnose problems and release fixes quickly.

# Bugs Fixed
* CSS Property description popup was missing for the custom background image position values.
* Selector Editing options in visual view didn't appear when switching selector under some conditions.
* When using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons in the visual view, dynamically added sections were missed out.
* Fixed some issues with the Enable sortable sections/selectors buttons. They didn't always appear or disappear when they were meant to.
* Dynamically created sections didn't have the selective export checkbox

1.3.2 (July 21, 2012)

# Enhancement
* Microthemer can now be used on Multisite WordPress installs thanks to Abland's work: http://themeover.com/forum/topic/settings-options-in-admin/
* After closing the visual view, scrolling to the last edited or triggering selector is now 4 x faster.
* Updated colorbox (for loading visual view) to version 1.3.19 with faster setup procedure

# Bugs Fixed
* When merging settings in the Microthemer UI, the active theme is set to "Custom Configuration" to more accurately describe the action taken by the user (it used to be set to the theme being imported, which didn't make much sense).
* Renaming a Section was not working. This resulted in downstream errors that negatively affected the Microthemer UI.
* Javascript errors in the Microthemer UI may result in selectors being malformed. In turn, this can create problems saving your settings. Whenever we identify JS errors we fix them. However, we wanted to implement a contingency plan. So now, Microthemer looks for malformed selectors and alerts you to exactly which selector you need to delete in order to restore normal functionality.
* Fixed a JS error that occurred after modifying a selector in the visual view under some circumstances
* After closing the visual view, the window didn't scroll to the triggering selector if nothing was edited.


1.3 (June 7, 2012)

# Enhancement
* Made the textarea for entering CSS selector code full width as I found it often needed manually resizing
* Added option to manually add !important declaration on a per style basis.
* When exporting to a new Micro Theme, the new theme is also available in the import select menu. Useful for when you want to selectively export sections and then easily copy them back into the UI using import with merge (no naming conflicts occur when you do this). 
* Updated CSS3 PIE to version 1.0 - first non-beta release.
* You can now specify custom x-axis and y-axis units for background image position
* Added an option to clear CSS style definitions in the Microthemer UI while keeping the sections and selectors intact. It's a useful way to easily update a Blank Slate Micro Theme after discovering the need for additional selectors during the design process.
* (minor) Moved dependent css styles condition into seperate function for more flexible use

# Bugs Fixed
* Renaming a selector that has the same name as it's parent section caused javascript errors in the Microthemer UI which presented as buttons not working etc.
* Under some circumstances, installing a Micro Theme resulted in the Theme being renamed as "None".
* When a Theme enqueues it's stylesheets there is a possibility that it's stylesheets will be called after Microthemer's stylesheet. Microthemer now checks the name of the theme so that it can specify which stylesheets should load BEFORE the Microthemer stylesheet. This was found to be necessary after adding support for ClassiPress.
* Selective export checkbox disappeared after renaming a section 
* When Microthemer checks for incorrect image paths, it presented the same image multiple times if it was used multiple times in the design.


1.1.9 (Apr 24, 2012)

# Bugs Fixed
* When trying to activate Microthemer, on some servers this caused the following error message: Warning: file_get_contents() [function.file-get-contents]: URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration

1.1.8 (Apr 19, 2012)

# Enhancement
* Files in Manage Themes table are organised alphabetically now.

# Bugs Fixed
* JS color conflict occurred when used with Templateer aided Artisteer Themes. New naming convention used to fix issue and prevent further issues.

1.1.7 (March 27, 2012)

# Enhancement
* Background image lists are now organised alphabetically
* Microthemer reminds you to activate the automatic update checker so that you can always have the most featur-rich and bug-free version of Microthemer

# Bugs Fixed
* Enabling !important on the Preferences page caused CSS3 PIE gradients to stop working in Internet Explorer 

1.1.4 (March 21, 2012)

# Enhancement
* HTML can now be added to the Readme.txt instructions textarea
* Micro Themes can be merged together by an additional import method in the Microthemer UI
* Microthemer UI Sections can be selectively exported to a Micro Theme - useful when combined with the merge method

# Bugs Fixed
* No code was changed, but a procedural problem to do with the plugin directory name changing with updates was found. This caused problem with CSS3 styles in Internet Explorer. This fix is discussed here: http://themeover.com/forum/topic/css3-styles-suddenly-stop-working-in-internet-explorer/

1.1.2 (March 12, 2012)

# Enhancement
* Auto-update feature added (needs activating on Preferences page)
* Added 'visibility' and 'cursor' CSS properties to the behaviour group in the microthemer UI

# Bugs Fixed
* The text-transform "capitalize" property was mis-spelt with an "s" so didn't work
* A call to an undefined jQuery object in jquery.overlay.js caused javascript problems
* On Windows Servers, erroneous https URLs caused server to hang
* Microthemer erroneously offerred to copy background images that were set to 'none' to a newly exported Micro Theme
* WordPress admin bar only hidden on Microthemer pages when visual view loads in Microthemer UI
* Creating a new theme from the Manage Themes page wasn't generating the necessary config.json file
* Auto-adding classes to first and last menu item can now be disabled via the preference page if it causes problems

1.0.7 (March 2, 2012)

# Enhancement
* Added support for WordPress Themes Created using Artisteer
* Option to globally add !important to CSS styles (needed to override some Artisteer CSS styles)

# Bugs Fixed
* position styles didn't register if applied without other style properties
* under some circumstances, javascript 'undefined' error killed script when modifying a CSS selector
* Added JS try-catch so rougue clicks don't trigger 'undefined' errors
* Prevented screenshot on Manage Themes page from being cached to avoid possible confusion

1.0 (February 24, 2012)

The initial release.
