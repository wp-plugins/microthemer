Customize the appearance of absolutely ANY WordPress Theme (no coding required). A Visual Theme Editor so good even programmers prefer it! 


== Description ==

**NEW:** Microthemer Lite is more than just a "Trial". As a tool for easily applying Google Web Fonts, this free Lite version is a great application in it's own right - checkout this <a target="_blank" href="http://themeover.com/easily-add-google-web-fonts-to-wordpress-with-free-microthemer-plugin/">Google Fonts video tutorial</a> to see how easy it is!

**Microthemer Lite** is a free trial of the much loved Microthemer plugin. It's fully functional, but you're limited to restyling 9 "elements" on your WordPress website e.g:

1. The site title
2. The site description
3. An image, or all images
4. A link, or all links
5. The search site input field
6. The search site button
7. A Post/Page
8. The Sidebar
9. The Footer
10. **Or any other 9 elements/type of element, these are just examples!**
 
(The full program allows you to edit an **unlimited** number of elements - read on to find out how!)

= What Can You Do With Microthemer & Who Is It For? =

There is one "**Killer Feature**" that makes Microthemer a rather extraordinary plugin. You simply double-click the thing you want to edit, and Microthemer will present over 70 options for restyling it! This versatility means that you can use Microthemer to customize the appearance of ANY WordPress Theme and ANY Content generated by a plugin (e.g. Contact Form 7 forms, or BuddyPress, or eCommerce shopping carts).

Although Microthemer was originally built as a solution for non-coders to be able to customize the appearance of their WordPress Theme (without having to learn CSS code), it has evolved into a proficiency tool for web designers/developers too. Like WordPress, Microthemer serves too distinct audiences at the same time, which is great for users who would like to start soft and then expand their web design skills.

= Main Features = 

1. Double-click anything on your web page and Microthemer will let you re-style it!
2. An intuitive visual editing mode so you can always see what you're working on
3. Over 70 different style options at your disposal (e.g. background color, font-family, CSS3 gradients)
4. Integrated with CSS3 PIE so your rounded corners, gradients, and box-shadow will work in Internet Explorer 6, 7 & 8 as well as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
5. You can export the designs you create with Microthemer as a zip file and then share them with your friends or sell them on <a title="Themover" href="http://themeover.com/" target="_blank">themeover.com</a>
6. You can install alternative designs for Themes or Plugins other users have uploaded to themeover.com (Free & Premium)
7. You can create a library of designs for your own development
8. First rate in-program docs so you can master the program and even learn about CSS (if you want to take things further)
9. Revision history feature - roll back to a previous point if you make a mistake or change your mind
10. Light-weight - 95% of the code doesn't load on non-Microthemer plugin pages so it won't slow down your site or admin area
11. Supports Multi-site
12. Supports SSL sites
13. Nonce security to help keep things secure
14. Easily add Google Web Fonts to your Theme

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is This Plugin Supported? =
Yes. Please post your question in <a title="Microthemer Support Forum" href="http://themeover.com/forum/" target="_blank">our Microthemer forum</a>.  

= Where can I find documentation? =
Microthemer has built-in documentation! Just click the Tutorials icon (accessible from the "More Options" icon) to load the Getting Started Videos, Tutorials, and CSS Reference. You can also search and post questions in our forum from there without having to leave the App.


== Screenshots ==

1. This is the visual editing view of Microthemer. Controls can be found above and below frontend of the website. In this screenshot we're giving the banner image of Twenty Twelve a purple dashed border. We've also got the sidebar menu open.
2. Here we're using Microthemer's CSS3 options (which also work for Internet Explorer 7 and 8 thanks to CSS3 PIE integration) to give the whole page a purple linear gradient. We've temporarily collapsed the sidebar menu to reduce clutter.
3. In this screenshot we've double-clicked the Site Description. Microthemer has responded by highlighting the Site Description (like firebug does) and loading a "Selector Wizard" that we can adjust before creating editing options for the Site Description. For instance, we might want to change the value in the dropdown menu to target all "H2" elements, rather than just the site title "H2" element. The highlighting is critical here to visually show non-coders what effect this will have without requiring them to actually understand the values in the list. 
4. This screenshot illustrates a feature that allows you to archive the designs you create in Microthemer (for later use, or to share with others) by exporting your design as a "Micro Theme"
5. If you make a mistake, Microthemer allows you to restore your workspace to a previous time.
