Customize the appearance of absolutely ANY WordPress Theme (no coding required). A Visual Theme Editor so good even programmers prefer it! 


== Description ==

**AMAZING** new responsive web design feature added! Preview your site in different screen sizes and easily apply styling for specific devices (e.g. large desktop, tablets, phones) without writing a lick of code.

**NEW:** Microthemer Lite is more than just a "Trial". As a tool for easily applying Google Web Fonts, this free Lite version is a great application in it's own right - checkout this <a target="_blank" href="http://themeover.com/easily-add-google-web-fonts-to-wordpress-with-free-microthemer-plugin/">Google Fonts video tutorial</a> to see how easy it is!

**Microthemer Lite** is a free trial of the much loved Microthemer plugin. It's fully functional, but you're limited to restyling 9 "elements" on your WordPress website e.g:

1. The site title
2. The site description
3. An image, or all images
4. A link, or all links
5. The search site input field
6. The search site button
7. A Post/Page
8. The Sidebar
9. The Footer
10. **Or any other 9 elements/type of element, these are just examples!**
 
(The full program allows you to edit an **unlimited** number of elements - read on to find out how!)

= What Can You Do With Microthemer & Who Is It For? =

There is one "**Killer Feature**" that makes Microthemer a rather extraordinary plugin. You simply double-click the thing you want to edit, and Microthemer will present over 70 options for restyling it! This versatility means that you can use Microthemer to customize the appearance of ANY WordPress Theme and ANY content generated by a plugin (e.g. Contact Form 7 forms, or BuddyPress, or eCommerce shopping carts).

Although Microthemer was originally built as a solution for non-coders to be able to customize the appearance of their WordPress Theme (without having to learn CSS code), it has evolved into a proficiency tool for web designers/developers too. Like WordPress, Microthemer serves too distinct audiences at the same time, which is great for users who would like to start soft and then expand their web design skills.

= Main Features = 

1. Double-click anything on your web page and Microthemer will let you re-style it!
2. An intuitive visual editing mode so you can always see what you're working on
3. Over 70 different style options at your disposal (e.g. background color, font-family, CSS3 gradients)
4. Integrated with CSS3 PIE so your rounded corners, gradients, and box-shadow will work in Internet Explorer 6, 7 & 8 as well as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
5. You can export the designs you create with Microthemer as a zip file and then share them with your friends or sell them on <a title="Themover" href="http://themeover.com/" target="_blank">themeover.com</a>
6. You can install alternative designs for Themes or Plugins other users have uploaded to themeover.com (Free & Premium)
7. You can create a library of designs for your own development
8. First rate in-program docs so you can master the program and even learn about CSS (if you want to take things further)
9. Revision history feature - roll back to a previous point if you make a mistake or change your mind
10. Light-weight - 95% of the code doesn't load on non-Microthemer plugin pages so it won't slow down your site or admin area
11. Supports Multi-site
12. Supports SSL sites
13. Nonce security to help keep things secure
14. Easily add Google Web Fonts to your Theme
15. Design **Responsive WordPress Themes** without the usual headaches. Easily preview your theme in different screen sizes and apply styles contained within media queries effortlessly. All without writing a single line of CSS code. Responsive web design calls for a tool like Microthemer to make life easier.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `microthemer` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to The Microthemer Menu item on the left
4. Tip: you may want to set the visual view to load by default on the Preferences page (most people don't use the Standard View anymore).
   


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is This Plugin Supported? =
Yes. Please post your question in <a title="Microthemer Support Forum" href="http://themeover.com/forum/" target="_blank">our Microthemer forum</a>.  

= Where can I find documentation? =
Microthemer has built-in documentation! Just click the Tutorials icon (accessible from the "More Options" icon) to load the Getting Started Videos, Tutorials, and CSS Reference. You can also search and post questions in our forum from there without having to leave the App.


== Screenshots ==

1. This is the visual editing view of Microthemer. Controls can be found above and below frontend of the website. In this screenshot we're giving the banner image of Twenty Twelve a purple dashed border. We've also got the sidebar menu open.
2. Here we're using Microthemer's CSS3 options (which also work for Internet Explorer 7 and 8 thanks to CSS3 PIE integration) to give the whole page a purple linear gradient. We've temporarily collapsed the sidebar menu to reduce clutter.
3. In this screenshot we've double-clicked the Site Description. Microthemer has responded by highlighting the Site Description (like firebug does) and loading a "Selector Wizard" that we can adjust before creating editing options for the Site Description. For instance, we might want to change the value in the dropdown menu to target all "H2" elements, rather than just the site title "H2" element. The highlighting is critical here to visually show non-coders what effect this will have without requiring them to actually understand the values in the list. 
4. This screenshot illustrates a feature that allows you to archive the designs you create in Microthemer (for later use, or to share with others) by exporting your design as a "Micro Theme"
5. If you make a mistake, Microthemer allows you to restore your workspace to a previous time.

== Upgrade Notice ==


2.6.1.1
* Found another call to the missing json class the previous version aimed to fix (2.6.1).

2.6.1
* When exporting settings to a settings pack, or invoking any function that used the json class, an error message was thrown in WordPress 3.9.

= 2.6.0 =
* Various PHP notices that could display on servers with strict error reporting have been fixed.

= 2.5.8 = 
* E_STRICT PHP error warnings could occur with PHP 5.4 due to code aimed at maintaining compatibility with PHP 4. This code has been removed. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

= 2.5.7 =
* There is now only one important "i" icon next to the last text-shadow input field. This makes much more sense.
* wordpress.org only - a file wasn't checked in which was necessary for the new responsive screen width slider to appear correctly.

= 2.5.6 =
* Media queries could be re-ordered but re-ordering did not have an effect with regards to the order the media queries were written to the active-style.css styleheet.

= 2.5.5 =
* Added a major new responsive design feature to the visual view. Preview the frontend in screen widths that correspond to min and max width values specified in your media queries. Also, you can easily adjust the preview screen size manually user a slider. You still have full editorial control over Microthemers default media queries.
* Some CSS tweaks to further improve the design with WordPress 3.8.
* Under some conditions discarding a media query tab in the style editing options could result in the editing options for the next tab that comes into focus remaining hidden.

= 2.5.2 =
* Various design improvements to ensure compatibility with WordPress 3.8

= 2.5.1 =
* PHP warning error when importing a settings pack that was made before Microthemer introduced media queries. Only affected Microthemer 2.5.

= 2.5 = 
* Major bug with device-specific CSS styles disappearing. Previously saved media query styles were overwritten by new ones if the section or selector was closed. This bug was masked prior to the last release (2.4.7) because sections and selectors remained open unless explicitly closed.
* When importing a theme pack that uses device specific css, the tabs could get messed up it focus wasn't left on 'All-devices'.
* Increased the CSS-specificity of Microthemer's own CSS styles on hidden Elements to ensure normal Javascript functioning too.

= 2.4.7 = 
* Under some conditions saving settings could result in an error. Servers that have a value in php.ini for max_input_vars (usually 1000) would sometimes truncate the data Microthemer sends to the server, resulting in a save error. Microthemer now warns you in advance if you are approaching your data-sending limits and suggest an easy fix - just hit the SpeedUp button in the right-hand menu.
* By default, Microthemer no longer remembers open sections/selectors when you return to the UI page. Doing so increased the likelihood of the data-limit error described above. However, you can adjust this behaviour via a new option on the preferences page.

= 2.4.5 = 
* Four additional Raw CSS Code textareas added for specifically targeting versions of Internet Explorer. Microthemer only includes these additional stylesheets if you make use of the new textareas so no unecessary stylesheets are ever included.

= 2.4.4 = 
* Option added to preferences page to set the viewport zoom level for any device to "1". This is on by default as it is necessary for the media queries to affect mobile and tablet devices correctly.

= 2.4.3 = 
* MAJOR BUG FIXED - Style values of zero (0) were ignored (not written to the CSS stylesheet) in the last version of Microthemer (2.4.1). 

= 2.4.1 = 
* Various bugs relating to media queries and illegal string offsets with PHP 5.4 were fixed

= 2.3.8 = 
* Microthemer now supports media queries for designing responsively

= 2.3.5 = 
* Email validation method now more reliable.
* Google Font variations can now be correctly used (click the variation before clicking the "Use this Font" link)
* Google Font url uses https if necessary to prevent mixed content warnings on SSL sites.

= 2.3.2 = 
- Works with MP6
- Transparency on mouseout can now be configured

= 2.2.9 = 
- Added support for Google Web Fonts - visual font-browser

= 2.2.3 = 
- Custom CSS style properties can now be added to Selectors in the CSS Selector textarea. Microthemer will look for the use of curly braces and include any CSS properties it finds in between the curly braces.

= 2.2.2 = 
The first release of Microthemer Lite on wordpress.org
