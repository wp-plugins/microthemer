A visual theme editor that allows you to responsively customize the appearance of any WordPress theme or plugin without writing code.


== Description ==

Microthemer is a feature-rich visual design plugin for customizing the appearance of any WordPress theme or plugin content, e.g. contact forms, down to the smallest detail. For CSS coders, Microthemer is a proficiency tool that comes with the ACE code editor with syntax highlighting and firebug-like computed CSS reporting. Now you can inspect and edit in one place. For non-programmers, Microthemer's intuitive interface and 'double-click to edit' features allow you to change the appearance of your website without writing a single line of code. Our tutorials and documentation will help you start in just minutes and our support team is there for you if you have any questions.

**Microthemer Lite** is a free trial that gives you full editing features and the same customer support paying customers receive. The only difference is that it limits you to editing/creating 9 'selectors’ e.g.

1. The site title.
2. The site description.
3. An image, or all images.
4. A link, or all links.
5. The search site input field.
6. The search site button.
7. A post/page.
8. The sidebar.
9. The footer.
10. **Or any other 9 elements you choose, these are just examples**.
 
The full program allows you to edit an **unlimited** number of elements – read on to find out how.


= What Can You Do With Microthemer & Who Is It For? =

To style your theme simply double-click the thing you want to edit, and choose from over 80 styling options to apply. This versatility means that you can use Microthemer to customize the appearance of any WordPress theme or plugin content such as Contact Form 7 forms, or BuddyPress, or eCommerce shopping carts.

= Main Features = 

1. Double-click anything on your web page and Microthemer will let you re-style it.
2. An intuitive visual editing mode so you can always see what you're working on.
3. Over 80 different style options at your disposal (e.g. background color, font-family, CSS3 gradients, drop shadow).
4. Integrated with CSS3 PIE so your rounded corners, gradients, and box-shadow will work in Internet Explorer 6, 7 & 8 as well as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
5. You can export the designs you create with Microthemer as a zip file and then share them with your friends or sell them on <a title="Themeover" href="http://themeover.com/" target="_blank">themeover.com</a>
6. You can install alternative designs for themes or plugins other users have uploaded to themeover.com (free & premium).
7. You can create a library of designs for your own development.
8. First rate in-program docs so you can master the program and even learn about CSS.
9. Revision history feature - roll back to a previous point if you make a mistake or change your mind.
10. Light-weight - 95% of the code doesn't load on non-Microthemer plugin pages so it won't slow down your site or admin area.
11. Supports multi-site.
12. Supports SSL sites.
13. Nonce security to help keep things secure.
14. Easily add Google Web Fonts to your theme.
15. Design **responsive WordPress themes** without the usual headaches. Easily preview your theme in different screen sizes and apply styles contained within media queries effortlessly. All without writing a single line of CSS code. Responsive web design calls for a tool like Microthemer to make life easier.

If you get stuck, you can get help here on the WordPress forum, or on <a title="Microthemer Support Forum" href="http://themeover.com/forum/" target="_blank">our dedicated Microthemer forum</a>.

To unlock the full program, you can purchase a <a href="http://themeover.com/microthemer/" target="_blank">Standard</a> ($45) or <a href="http://themeover.com/microthemer/" target="_blank">Developer</a> ($90) license.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `microthemer` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to The Microthemer Menu item on the left
4. Tip: you may want to set the visual view to load by default on the Preferences page (most people don't use the Standard View anymore).
   


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is This Plugin Supported? =
Yes. Please post your question in <a title="Microthemer Support Forum" href="http://themeover.com/forum/" target="_blank">our Microthemer forum</a>.  

= Where can I find documentation? =
Microthemer has built-in documentation! Just click the help icon (top right of the interface) to load the tutorials and CSS Reference. You can also search and post questions in our forum from there without having to leave the Microthemer interface.


== Screenshots ==

1. Microthemer’s intuitive interface sits above your site to make it easy to see the changes as you make them.
2. To start editing simply double click an element, give it a name and save it a folder to create a selector.
3. Microthemer comes with over 80 CSS styling properties grouped into eleven categories. In this screenshot we can see border options, such as color, width, radius and style.
4. The main menu allows you organise and manage your folders and selectors. You can simply drag and drop them into the required position, as well as copy, edit, or delete. 
5. Microthemer includes a revision restore feature. The past 50 actions that alter your workspace are remembered. So if you make a mistake you can easily roll back to a previous point.
6. The advanced selector wizard options show you the computed CSS for anything you double-click, just like right-click with firebug.
7. The targeting tab includes a list of potential selectors from the very specific to the very broad. Microthemer understands that sometimes users want to target a set of elements, such as all page titles, rather than just the page title on the ‘About’ page for instance. 
8. Easily preview your site as if you were viewing it on phone or tablet as you design and apply screen width specific styles to make your theme fully responsive.
9. You can view the CSS code Microthemer generates for debugging or copying and pasting elsewhere. Some users like the fact you can deactivate Microthemer and still make the use of the styles (without having to copy and paste).

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 4.0 (July 12th) =

New Features
* Easier to add responsive styles.
* Improved color picker.
* Pixel rulers on the X and Y axis.
* Quick preview feature for common devices added to top left corner of the rulers
* Ems/rems used in media queries now preview at the correct width on the responsive tabs
* Specify default CSS units e.g. ems, vw, % instead of implicitly defaulting to pixels.
* Full screen mode.
* Collapse or expand the Microthemer interface with the logo.
* Preview selectors when hovering over selector names.

Design Changes
* The left toolbar icons have been moved to the top right of the interface. Some have been grouped together. Related options display on hover.
* The folder and selector management options have been moved to the top left.
* The responsive slider has been replaced by the rulers. Drag the rulers or click on a point to adjust the screen width. Rulers shading shows the scope of the current responsive tab.
* The media query tabs are now above the CSS property groups and are always visible. They can be hidden via the Edit Media Queries popup.
* The selector wizard options all display to the right of the page. The advanced options are always visible. The selector wizard does not replace the normal editing options. It appears above them.
* Little blue or white feather icons are used to indicate when styles have been added to a selector, media query tab, or property group.
* The color picker has been updated. It now supports RGB/A and HSL/A color codes.
* Default computed colors are show by a bottom border on the new color picker field (which is a small square now).

Functional Changes
* Microthemer doesn't use the crosshair mouse icon anymore because this was artificially changing the computed CSS for the mouse cursor property.
* The media query tabs do not lock the screen width slider at a minimum or maximum screen width. The shading shows the scope of the media query conditions. And if the user drags outside the scope of the media query a warning icon is displayed in the top left of the rulers.
* Hovering over the selector's name in the top toolbar temporarily triggers highlighting and auto-scrolls to the right place in the page.
* Continuity has been given precedence. When switching between property groups (e.g. font to padding) the responsive tab never changes. This holds true when switching between selectors. When switching between selectors, Microthemer no longer remembers the property group that was last edited on that selector. It favours continuity and stays on the same property group the previous selector was on.

3.9 Beta Bugs fixed
* Color picker had some annoying glitches when dragging the picker outside the bounds of the box
* Comma separated CSS selectors weren't highlighting properly (only the first in the list would highlight)

= 3.9.2 (beta) (July 1, 2015) =
* A fresh install of the new beta version could cause an Javascript error because the frontend script tried to load a non-existent stylesheet.
* The dynamic javascript wasn't enqueued in the correct way which prevented the interface from fully loading.

= 3.9.0 (beta) (June 26, 2015) =
* Many new updates. A full description will come when we're past the beta stage.

= 3.7.5 (May 24, 2015) =
* Microthemer is now translation ready following JoseLuís' sterling work.
* Added more thorough directory path analysis for advanced WordPress configurations.

= 3.7.3 (May 9, 2015) =
* Plain http requests to Google fonts caused issues on SSL sites.
* Fixed path to languages folder

= 3.7.2 (May 6, 2015) =
* New selector wizard targeting system trialed in edge mode has become permanent
* First phase of translation: various text strings are now translatable. Thanks to JoseLuís for providing this: https://github.com/joseluis/
* Improved compatibility with any font awesome stylesheets that load on the Microthemer UI page (via another plugin)

= 3.6.9 (May 5, 2015) =
* The last 3.6.7 release introduced a bug with the unlock process.

= 3.6.8 (May 4, 2015) =
* Major Bug fixed. When importing with "Merge", any responsive tab settings being imported would be lost. So too would any custom !important declarations.

= 3.6.7 (Apr 23, 2015) =
* Microthemer conflicted with the Contact Form Maker plugin.
* Single or double-clicking form submit buttons didn't work as a result of the 3.5.9 update.
* Microthemer would follow links if they were the parent of a double-clicked grandchild element.
* Microthemer wouldn't allow styling links that lead back to the admin area (this was an unintended consequence of preventing single-click navigation to the admin area).

= 3.6.3 (Apr 20, 2015) =
* The computed CSS appears when hovering over the CSS property LABEL instead of the form field. We think tooltips should get out of the way of input fields. And we think it's neater to show the label and computed value alongside each other e.g. "Font Weight: bold".
* The color picker would not disappear on blur following the last 3.5.9 update (you had to click the close button).
* The styling of selector suggestions on hover poses less confusion about which suggestion is actually selected. They have a grey background on hover and the current selector continues to look like an editable textarea until another one is clicked.
* Information icons appear on hover for the selector wizard suggestions for showing the tooltip without the tooltip getting in the way of the code.

= 3.5.9 (Apr 19, 2015) =
* An 'Edge mode' option has been added to the preferences. You can enable this to try out experimental new features and have your say on them before they become permanent. Useful for those that want to take an active role in shaping Microthemer.
* Custom tooltips have been added to the interface. You can configure these via the preferences.
* Selectors suggestions on the targeting tab have more descriptive explanations and show quickly with the new tooltip.
* The inside label on the folder field of the selector wizard had a glitch
* jQuery version checking could be inaccurate under some circumstances.
* Targeting inputs by type wasn't working
* Microthemer could follow links to plain images and find itself at an impasse.
* Microthemer could follow links to the admin and then possibly back to Microthemer.
* Microthemer now waits for 700ms instead of 300ms for a second click when a user double-clicks something. Some people were naturally double-clicking with less than 300ms between each click. I will make the delay time configurable if people request this.
* The selector targeting tab has a regular scrollbar on the right instead of a vertical slider. Switching between the options is be done by hovering your mouse over them (for quick preview) and then clicking the suggestion you want.
3.5 (Apr 10, 2015)
* jQuery version checking could be inaccurate under some circumstances.

= 3.4.9 (Apr 7, 2015) =
* An undefined index PHP error could show when upgrading from a previous version to version 3.4.4 (when the WP admin shortcut link was added)
* Some undefined errors could be generated on the UI page. These were hidden behind the interface but could result in a slow page load if present.

= 3.4.7 (Apr 4, 2015) =
* Chrome could fail when trying to load the selector wizard if it encountered any computed CSS values with rgba opacity set to more than 2 decimal places e.g. 0.745.
* Double-clicking an already highlighted element closes the selector wizard instead of showing a warning.
* On multi-site, Microthemer creates the micro-themes folder in /wp-content/uploads/sites/ if the blogs.dir directory doesn't already exist (modern multi-site installs don't create the blogs.dir folder).


= 3.4.4 (Apr 3, 2015) =
* Added an option for accessing Microthemer from the WP admin bar. This can be turned off via the preferences page if you don't want it cluttering your admin bar.
* There is an import icon next to each design pack on the Manage & Install design packs page. This takes you to the import page and preselects the right design pack.
* The 'clear styles but leave folders & selectors intact' option didn't clear styles applied on responsive tabs.

= 3.4.1 (Mar 11, 2015) =
* Double-clicking an element with text no longer highlights the actual word clicked, which resulted in confusing highlighting.
* Microthemer initially uses home_url() to load the site preview as site_url() can sometimes be incorrect.
* Possibility of an undefined variable $logs on line 1110 of tvr-microthemer.php
* Possibility of an undefined index disable_parent_css on line 5515 of tvr-microthemer.php

= 3.3.7 (Feb 15, 2015) =
* Folders and selector are APPENDED instead of PRE-PENDED when added to the interface. Rationale: It keeps folders and selectors in the chronological order that they were created, the back and forward quick nav buttons work more intuitively, if two selectors have equal specificity the latter will override the previously created one.
* For consistency, the same goes for custom media queries. They are appended, and the 'NEW' button has been moved below them.
* Only folders that have 1 or more selectors are auto-checked on the settings export screen.
* All folders/selectors/custom media queries would flash for a split second when adding a new item to them.
* There is a known bug in firefox where media queries don't take effect on the exact pixel specified. Styles set within a media query tab didn't always seem to take an effect at 767px for instance when the media query specified a max-width of 767px (as it does on the 'Tablet & Phone' media query). Only at 766.7px do the styles work. For now, I've implemented a fix for this (automatically subtracting 0.3px from the preview screen width). I am following this bug on bugzilla. I will remove the temporary fix when it is no longer necessary.
* Unnecessary console.logs functions for debugging were included in the previous release which could cause problems for IE9.
* The media query tabs can be added by clicking the actual text in the tab management menu (not just the + icon). This feels more natural.
* The folder >> Selector breadcrumbs arrows have the default mouse cursor on hover to indicate that they're not clickable.
* Microthemer would get stuck when deleting the last selector while in 'quick edit folder' view.
* The new 'media query sets' loading feature had some teething problems.
* Using the following CSS pseudo selectors caused problems: :before, ::before, :after, ::after. Thanks again to Antonio for spotting this.
* The screen-width slider didn't show with the selector wizard 100% of the time.
* The computed CSS values for the single double-clicked element were not recalculated following a screen width refresh.

= 3.2.4 (Feb 14, 2015) =
* When saving different styles in quick succession, the latest style change wasn't always saved if a save was already in progress. Now the saves queue up to ensure that the latest setting applies.
* The selector wizard could fail to show if other Javascripts altered the format of the computed CSS data jQuery returned.
* The selector wizard could also fail to show after double-clicking in Chrome under some circumstances.

= 3.2.1 (Feb 10, 2015 - later in the afternoon) =
* The selector wizard displays link :pseudo classes in the correct order (that corresponds to the position of the slider handle)
* An undefined variable could throw a warning with strict error reporting server settings enabled.
* Unnecessary debug output was being generated behind the scenes. And unnecessary source file for a pollyfill were included.
* The selector wizard caused the manual 'Add Selector' options to be expanded when they needn't be.
* Manual selector values were not being cleared from the input fields upon 'cancel'

= 3.1.6 (Feb 10, 2015) =
* Microthemer remembers your preference for showing/unshowing the advanced options of the selector wizard. No need for the checkbox now.
* Microthemer remembers which tab of the advanced wizard you last used.
* Microthemer remembers your preference for having the left toolbar expanded or closed.
* Microthemer remembers the last viewed selector when reloading the page, even if you didn't apply styles to it.
* The link back to the WordPress dashboard is a real link so that you can open it in a new tab with right-click.
* The media query tabs editing menu options are more similar to the format used for editing folders and selectors. An additional 'clear' option has been added for clearing all the styles for a style group at once.

= 3.1 (Feb 8, 2015)
* Some alternative media query 'sets' can be loaded. These encourage the use of mobile-first/semantic breakpoints.
* Deleting all media queries will actually reset the default media queries (rather than just purporting to)
* Hovering your mouse over a media query tab shows the underlying media query code.
* The color picker didn't allow RGB or RGBA values if there was a space before the brackets e.g. "RGBA ()".
* Navigating to selector from the main menu or quick edit menus closes the open menu
* The 'Double-click an element to create editing options for it' title attribute is no longer dynamically added to the <body> element of the preview iframe.
* The in-program docs now link to the new online support index page, taking this version out of beta.
* Each CSS property has a direct link to the online CSS reference by clicking the CSS property icon
* Microthemer recalculates and reports the correct computed CSS following actions that change the preview screen width (e.g. adjusting the slider or switching between media query tabs). Thanks for reporting this Rob.
* Selector highlighting is recalculated instantly when a new style is applied that affects the dimensions of the targets element(s). Thanks again to Rob for spotting this.
* Cursor options no longer have a scrollbar in the dropdown menu, which partially obscured the options.

= 3.0.16 (beta) =
* The pre-populated selector name value for all selectors in a folder was overwritten by the most recent selector created via the selector wizard. Thanks for spotting this Antonio!
* Importing a design pack made with Microthemer 1.x (before media query tabs were added) would result in PHP errors.

= 3.0.14 (beta) =
* Improved the icon and description for the media query tab management menu. A few more improvements for this feature are on the way.
* If a media query tab (e.g. "Phone") was used in the absence of the default "All Devices" tab, settings applied to the media query tab would not save.
* When importing 2.x settings, media query tabs did not always display correctly
* Dropdown menu toggle arrows were misaligned by one pixel in Firefox.

= 3.0.11 (beta)
* The appearance of the slider handle for the selector wizard element targeting tab also needed fixing in WP 4.1
* The notification about disabling highlighting when double-clicking something that is already highlighted was confusing.
* In rare cases Microthemer was not remembering the last frontend page viewed in the preview window.

= 3.0.8 (beta) =
* On multi-site, the "back to WordPress dashboard" icon in the left toolbar took the user back to the root admin dashboard instead of the intended blog dashboard.
* With WordPress 4.1 there were a few display issues relating to jQuery UI widgets like sliders and pseudo select comboboxes.
- The preview screen width slider handle was not correctly styled (it was too big).
- The dropdown menus looked a bit ugly and it wasn't possible to specify an empty value to clear the field.
* With jquery versions older than 1.9, a javascript error could prevent the selector wizard from loading when double-clicking an element. Now Microthemer warns you to update jQuery.
* Microthemer was sometimes creating a debug-save.txt file in the root /micro-themes/ folder. This caused a blank design pack to be displayed on the manage design packs page that could not be deleted via the delete button. If you installed version 3.0 and you see a nameless design pack on the manage packs page, please delete the following file via FTP: /wp-content/micro-themes/debug-save.txt (or ask Themeover for help with this).
* Microthemer will not run with versions earlier than 3.6 (it will warn you to upgrade WordPress)
* The reported CSS could sometimes be too big for the input field and looked messy. If there is not enough room the value is truncated with a ... suffix. The full computed CSS value can still be viewed by hovering your mouse over the input field.
* The icons for text-shadow X and Y offset were wrong. "Spread" will be added to these shadow options soon.
* An innocuous javascript error was generated if exporting the first design pack when no others exist.

= 3.0 (beta) =
# Note: this is a beta because it was released without updated documentation
* Much nicer icon-based UI with far more space available for seeing the site your designing and NO overlap of editing options.
* Everything is accessible from the Microthemer UI page (e.g. design pack installation and management, updating global preferences and media queries)
* Much easier management of sections (now called folders) and selectors. You can copy and move selectors between folders with drag and drop too.
* Code editor with syntax highlighting for those that still like to program. You can still see the frontend site while you write your code. Clicking control+S to save means that you see your changes instantly.
* Some new style options (e.g. box-sizing, background-size) with more (animation/transition) options on the way in a later release.
* Background images are now managed via the wordpress media manager. On installing a pack with images, they are extracted to the library and image paths are updated automatically. When you download a pack, linked imaged are downloaded from the image library and included in the zip package. It should make working with background images much easier.
* The selector wizard is now easier to use. It has a slider for tweaking your targeting instead of the dropdown menu. And computed CSS is reported at the wizard stage too. In a later release the HTML inspection will be improved further.
* Import/Export of settings has been improved.
* limits caused by PHP's max_input_vars settings which could cause problems saving your settings if the number of input vars exceeded the limit (typically 1000) is no longer an issue. Microthemer serializes input values into one and then splits them back to normal on the server side.
* background images can have spaces in the names e.g. "my images with spaces.jpg"
* Resetting, importing, and restoring settings used to pass parameters in the URL. Refreshing the page (which some of us do habitually) could cause unwanted old actions (like resetting the interface) to be repeated accidentally. Now all actions are submitted via ajax and the Microthemer URL remains clean at all times.
* Microthemer doesn't set viewport to 1 by default. If you plan to make use of the media query feature please set this to 1 on the media queries management page.
* CSS3 PIE isn't turned on globally by default


= 2.8.2 (Sept 16, 2014 =
* The helps links to the videos, tutorials, and forum were not working on the Preferences or Manage Themes pages.
* Microthemer no longer displays your email address on the unlock page once you have successfully validated your email address.
This is useful if you have purchased a developer license and you do not want your clients to see your email address.
* Also, the free trial notice disappears after unlocking the program.
* The "Free Trial Example Section" is now just called "Example Section" to avoid confusion over whether or not the program is really unlocked after validating your email address.

= 2.7.8 (Sept 8, 2014) =
* Text-shadow colour could not be set to "none" to effectively disable any existing text-shadow values.
* RGB AND RGBA colour values could not be set without Microthemer auto-adjusting them to solid hex values. RGB/RGBA values can now be manually added. The color picker will receive some proper attention in the near future to ensure maximum flexibility and ease of use.
* A call to an undefined javascript function caused an error in the browser console. Although the error didn't seem to disrupt normal functioning of the program.

= 2.7.5 (Sept 1, 2014) =
* The new feature of computing the CSS could slow, and potentially crash the browser. This could happen when analysing high numbers of page elements (e.g. 30 links on the page) combined with lots of properties having mixed values (e.g. a font-size of 12px, 18px, 21px). As A quick fix, we have set the maximum number of elements on the page that can be scanned to 10 (instead of 50). We will increase this figure (to around 30) when we release version 3 in about one month. Version 3 will segment the display of property groups (e.g. just padding or just behaviour) rather than displaying all properties at once and so will be able to analyse more elements on the page without resulting in performance issues.
* Also, related to the above, Microthemer now excludes the WP admin bar from restyling for performance reasons.
* If a selector contained the :link pseudo selector, this wasn't correctly filtered when constructing selector highlighting divs.

= 2.7.3 (Aug 8, 2014) =
* Computed CSS reporting failed if the CSS selector code contained one of the following pseudo selectors - :hover, :active, :visited

= 2.7.2 (Aug 06, 2014) =
* Google font subsets e.g. "subset=latin,latin-ext" can now be set on the Microthemer > Preferences page
* An error occurred when using single or double quotes in selectors e.g. input[type="text"]

= 2.7.1 =
* Microthemer can now be used as a substitute for firebug as a tool for analysing an element's existing computed CSS values. Microthemer now shows the computed values as overlays on the editing options so you can view CSS value reporting and make an edit in exactly the same place.
* Font weight can be applied as a century number from 100 to 900.

* The little "i"s for manually applying the !important CSS declaration got lost for a while.
* When exporting to a theme, it was possible to not select anything from the dropdown menu.
* Custom google font still rendered if the field wasn't cleared before switching back to a regular web safe font in the dropdown.
* Auto-save was a bit sketchy with Google Fonts too
* Microthemer auto-saves when property options are deleted or a selector is modified now to more accurately present the state of things.
* Microthemer now includes the background-color in the CSS3 gradient declaration. It will always be trumped by the gradient but not doing this resulting in incorrect reporting of the background-color property (now that Microthemer reports this information)

= 2.6.3 =
* Style changes appear much quicker now (almost immediately). As such, auto-save is now the default mode (although it can be disabled). Also, auto-save is trggered when you finish typing into text fields (after a 700ms delay, rather than when focus is removed). 
* Microthemer remembers the last page you viewed when you return to the visual view site preview

= 2.6.1.1 =
* Found another call to the missing json class the previous version aimed to fix (2.6.1).

= 2.6.1 =
* When exporting settings to a settings pack, or invoking any function that used the json class, an error message was thrown in WordPress 3.9.

= 2.6.0 =
* Various PHP notices that could display on servers with strict error reporting have been fixed.

= 2.5.8 = 
* E_STRICT PHP error warnings could occur with PHP 5.4 due to code aimed at maintaining compatibility with PHP 4. This code has been removed. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

= 2.5.7 =
* There is now only one important "i" icon next to the last text-shadow input field. This makes much more sense.
* wordpress.org only - a file wasn't checked in which was necessary for the new responsive screen width slider to appear correctly.

= 2.5.6 =
* Media queries could be re-ordered but re-ordering did not have an effect with regards to the order the media queries were written to the active-style.css styleheet.

= 2.5.5 =
* Added a major new responsive design feature to the visual view. Preview the frontend in screen widths that correspond to min and max width values specified in your media queries. Also, you can easily adjust the preview screen size manually user a slider. You still have full editorial control over Microthemers default media queries.
* Some CSS tweaks to further improve the design with WordPress 3.8.
* Under some conditions discarding a media query tab in the style editing options could result in the editing options for the next tab that comes into focus remaining hidden.

= 2.5.2 =
* Various design improvements to ensure compatibility with WordPress 3.8

= 2.5.1 =
* PHP warning error when importing a settings pack that was made before Microthemer introduced media queries. Only affected Microthemer 2.5.

= 2.5 = 
* Major bug with device-specific CSS styles disappearing. Previously saved media query styles were overwritten by new ones if the section or selector was closed. This bug was masked prior to the last release (2.4.7) because sections and selectors remained open unless explicitly closed.
* When importing a theme pack that uses device specific css, the tabs could get messed up it focus wasn't left on 'All-devices'.
* Increased the CSS-specificity of Microthemer's own CSS styles on hidden Elements to ensure normal Javascript functioning too.

= 2.4.7 = 
* Under some conditions saving settings could result in an error. Servers that have a value in php.ini for max_input_vars (usually 1000) would sometimes truncate the data Microthemer sends to the server, resulting in a save error. Microthemer now warns you in advance if you are approaching your data-sending limits and suggest an easy fix - just hit the SpeedUp button in the right-hand menu.
* By default, Microthemer no longer remembers open sections/selectors when you return to the UI page. Doing so increased the likelihood of the data-limit error described above. However, you can adjust this behaviour via a new option on the preferences page.

= 2.4.5 = 
* Four additional Raw CSS Code textareas added for specifically targeting versions of Internet Explorer. Microthemer only includes these additional stylesheets if you make use of the new textareas so no unecessary stylesheets are ever included.

= 2.4.4 = 
* Option added to preferences page to set the viewport zoom level for any device to "1". This is on by default as it is necessary for the media queries to affect mobile and tablet devices correctly.

= 2.4.3 = 
* MAJOR BUG FIXED - Style values of zero (0) were ignored (not written to the CSS stylesheet) in the last version of Microthemer (2.4.1). 

= 2.4.1 = 
* Various bugs relating to media queries and illegal string offsets with PHP 5.4 were fixed

= 2.3.8 = 
* Microthemer now supports media queries for designing responsively

= 2.3.5 = 
* Email validation method now more reliable.
* Google Font variations can now be correctly used (click the variation before clicking the "Use this Font" link)
* Google Font url uses https if necessary to prevent mixed content warnings on SSL sites.

= 2.3.2 = 
- Works with MP6
- Transparency on mouseout can now be configured

= 2.2.9 = 
- Added support for Google Web Fonts - visual font-browser

= 2.2.3 = 
- Custom CSS style properties can now be added to Selectors in the CSS Selector textarea. Microthemer will look for the use of curly braces and include any CSS properties it finds in between the curly braces.

= 2.2.2 =
